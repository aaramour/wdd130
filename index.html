    <h1>Aaron Eardley</h1>
    <p>
      Riders of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers! I see in your eyes the same fear
      that would take the heart of me. The day may come when the courage of men
      fails, but it is <strong>not</strong> this day. An hour of wolves and
      shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not
      this day! This day, we <em>fight!</em> By all that you hold dear, I bid
      you stand, Men of the West!
