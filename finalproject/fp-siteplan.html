          <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            Last night I was ready to unwind and just watch some TV. I logged in
            to Netflix and I felt like I tried to find what to watch for a
            longer time than I actually watched something. And what I did watch
            wasn’t even any good! Anyway, I’ve got this idea to build a website.
            You’ll tell it what streaming services you have and it will make
            recommendations based on internet reviews. If you’ve seen it
            already, you mark “seen it” (or “love” or “hate”). You can also
            filter by genres and things like adult content. With a site like
            this, we could spend time watching rather than spending time blindly
            choosing!

          <h2>Site Map and Content</h2>
          <p>
            This site will allow users to search movies and TV shows first and
            foremost. On the main page there will be a search bar to search
            titles. There will be a way to filter searches by movie/show, by
            rating (PG, R, etc), and filters by genre, and by duration (binge
            watch over the weekend vs a movie right now). By default the user
            will have entered which streaming services they have, but there will
            be an easy way to check and uncheck services and to only show my
            services or show all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Search Results page will show the results from the search. Each
            movie/show will have its own page once selected. This page will
            provide an extremely brief rundown of each movie with Genres,
            Rating, Ranking, and 2 streaming services.
          </p>
          <p>
            The page for each movie/show will display more content than the
            search results page. It will have brief rundowns of ratings,
            rankings, genres, streaming services, and related films/shows.
