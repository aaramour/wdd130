          <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            Last night I was ready to unwind and just watch some TV. I logged in
            to Netflix and I felt like I tried to find what to watch for a
            longer time than I actually watched something. And what I did watch
            wasn’t even any good! Anyway, I’ve got this idea to build a website.
            You’ll tell it what streaming services you have and it will make
            recommendations based on internet reviews. If you’ve seen it
            already, you mark “seen it” (or “love” or “hate”). You can also
            filter by genres and things like adult content. With a site like
            this, we could spend time watching rather than spending time blindly
            choosing!

          <h2>Intended Target Audience</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Those who want to check which movies/shows are on which services.</li>
            <li>2. Those who want to browse movies/shows by genre/actor/rating etc</li>
            <li>3. Those who want movie/show recommendations given to them</li>
            <li>4. Those who want to track and rate what they watch and/or build a watch lists</li>
