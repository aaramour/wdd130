        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this site is to be the center of information for the
          consumer interested in adventurously exploring the St. Johns River in
          Jacksonville, FL. The information contained in will answer any
          questions the consumer may have, such as how much a trip will cost and
          what kind of equipment or gear will need to be rented and/or
          purchased. The site will allow the consumer to purchase an expedition
          package and any gear required. The site will have a section for
          frequently asked questions and contact information for more specific
          questions. The site will also have a section for purchase of branded
          memorabilia and equipment for purchase in order to increase revenue.
          Ultimately the site is intended to be the place where a consumer can
          discover Dry Oar and book a trip the same day. The site will answer
          questions like "What is there to do in North Florida?" and "What does
          an expedition look like from start to finish as far as time and cost
          and equipment?" and "What if I am looking for more of a thrill? What's
          next for me?"

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
          The audience for this site is going to be young adults looking for a
          new adventure or parents looking for a memorable family outing in
          North Florida or South Georgia. There are different expeditions
          packages available in order to reduce cost for the consumer as much as
          possible and include someone from all backgrounds. We want to cater to
          those that are looking for something new to do but also want to
          provide enough fun for experienced rafters to have a local rafting
          company to spend their time with. The audience will access the site
          through mobile device or laptop generally when they are looking for
          something fun to do or when they already know they want to go rafting
          in Jacksonville.
